# Amazon_Review_Sentiment_Analysis

Update: My project just got Bronze medal upvotes from Kaggle!

This project is based on the online dataset found on Kaggle. The link to the bz2 files (test and train sets) is the following:

The notebook can be run chronologically to get the results and graphs shown. If you wish to run the project, the slight change you need to make is to change the file's path to match your local path file after you downloaded the bz2 file.

The link of my original Kaggle notebook is as follows:
